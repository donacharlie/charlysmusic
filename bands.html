						<img scr="images/C&Eduo.jpg" alt="Charlene & Eve's photo">
						<p>Charlène started to play music 12 years ago in Ireland. Her Armenian roots led her to playing first Eastern European music. On her journey she met wonderful musicians who introduced her to scandinavian music and  went then studying in Sweden.  She then came back to Ireland and studied in AMP and GCC ans started playing Irish music. Since that time she has been playing different styles of music (folk and trad from many countries) all around Europe, touring in Slovenia, Sweden, France, Italy...Playing gigs, enjoying joining in sessions, playing in festivals and workshops inspired her as well as many friends she met on the road. In Bruxelles she met Eve (graduated in classical guitar from Liège Conservatory and also studying the accordeon)<br>Coming from completely different musical background and origins, Eve and Charlene complete each other harmoniously and share their passion for music through this duo, going from Irish music to Balkan music, to trad from here and there.</p>
